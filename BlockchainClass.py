''' BlockchainClass.py - Blockchain class and supporting functions.

In this implementation we are avoiding using a list to hold block objects. This 
decision is to help work on data structures more complex than lists and give a 
better idea of how blockchains link data together. (Hint: if you're stuck, try 
looking up Linked Lists and do some reading.)
