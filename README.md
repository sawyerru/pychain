## PyChain
### Starting Code
This project will teach you the basics of blockchains (as implemented in the Bitcoin protocol).

There are a few files you'll aquaint yourself with to start:
1. main.py - this is where the main interaction occurs with the user. It will be completed mainly for you
2. BlockClass.py - contains the Block Class object and supporting functions. Use the docstrings and comments to implement the functions.
3. BlockchainClass.py - contains the Blockchain Class object and supporting functions. Again, use the doc strings and comments to inform your solution. 
4. testing.py - this file has been completed for you. Use it to test your code and make sure it works properly.
